#Microscope webcam
From our meeting with Laura, the following points are noted:

##Choice of camera
A playstation camera provides good results. Laura has also tried hacking cheap
webcameras, which is also possible. It might be possible to find old cameras in
the IT department.

When hacking the playstation camera, you must be careful when opening it, as it
must be a very precise cut. If not careful, you might damage the lense.

It is a good idea to start with cheap cameras, but it might be necessary to look
at more expensive cameras for the application.

##Lighting
The lighting is of high importance; consider whether to light from sides /
bottom / both etc.

##Vibrations
Vibrations are likely to be very important both concerning the camera and the
petri dish. It is most likely that taking images between steps is the best
solution.

##Cutting the plastic
In Intermedia Lab, Cathrine is able to help us using the laser cutter if needed.

##Focus and adjustments
The microscope construction made by Laura includes a screw for adjusting the
plate above the camera. Such adjustment is needed for the camera to focus
correctly.

##Burrowing the microscope webcam
We may burrow the webcam, but she would like it back at some point.
