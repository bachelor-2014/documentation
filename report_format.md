#Report format: Focus and structure
The report of the bachelor project will focus on the construction and
development taking place as part of the project. Most weight will be put on the
design decisions leading to the final result, along with arguments for these
decisions, the theory behind them, and how the support the final goal.

A further focus is on experimentation with different methods as a way of
argumenting for choosing the methods best supporting the goals of the project.

The following is a possible outline of the report:

1. The purpose of the project (bachelor and EVOBLISS)
2. For each part of the project (such as setting up the BeagleBone Black, doing
image stitching, handling motion blur etc.), the theories behind what has been
done are explained, the product is documented, and the design decisions and
experiments are discussed. Further, testing of the results must be included.
3. A discussion of the overall achieval of the project goals.

Which parts of the project that are discussed thoroughly and which are not will
be decided, as the project moves along, as it is at that point it is known
which parts are worth focusing on.
